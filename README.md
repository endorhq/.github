Setting up development environments is hard. We are building Endor to change that. Point your web browser to [endor.dev](https://endor.dev), select the components your app needs and hit "Launch". Seconds later it is up and running and you can deploy your code, either from a local folder or directly from your repository.

**Everything is executed inside the browser and private by default**. When you are done, just delete the browser tab and you are done! It canâ€™t get easier than that.
